        <h2>A Bit About Osaka</h2>
        <p>This website will show you a couple of interesting places you can see in Osaka if you choose to visit.</p>
        <p>Osaka is one of the three major cities in Japan, with over 2.6 million residents. It's also the third safest city in the world which makes it a great place for a vacation.</p>
        <p>Traditionally considered Japan's economic hub, it still holds most of that energy with the countless tourist destinations residing inside.</p>
        <p>Central Osaka is home to many attractions and landmarks, however, it's good to keep in mind that it's broken down into its uptown and downtown areas: Kita (キタ, "north") and Minami (ミナミ, "south"). Well-known districts in Minami include Namba and Shinsaibashi shopping areas, the Dōtonbori canal entertainment area, Nipponbashi Den Den Town, as well as arts and fashion culture-oriented areas such as Amerikamura and Horie.</p>
        <p>If I've done my job right, then by the time you've looked through this site, you'll have a a little bit of knowledge about the city that you can share with friends and family <span id="spin">:)</span></p>
