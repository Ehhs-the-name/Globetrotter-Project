					<div class="attraction-description">
					<p>Osaka Castle is the most famous landmark of the city, a must-see for anyone touring Osaka. Originally completed in 1583, the castle has been under much duress and repair—from World War II and various attacks throughout the years. As of 1995, reconstruction has ended, and its beauty shines through.</p>
					<p>While in the area, make sure to enjoy the castle's park and Osaka Museum of History. Admission for adults is 600 yen and 400 yen for college and high school students.</p></div>

					</figure>
					<div class="attraction-description">
					<p>The temple was built over 1,400 years ago, to fulfil a vow Prince Shotoku made after winning the battle between Mononobe and Soga clans. Since then, it's been through many disasters. However, after many restorations, it stands with glory today, providing Buddhist education through the Shitennoji Gakuen school corporation.</p>
					<p>Restorations are kept in the same style as the Asuka period. Buddist rituals, traditional performances, and cultural festivals take place. To give respect and celebrate its history, the Bugaku Grand Ceremony is held every year on April 22nd in memory of Prince Shotoku.</p>
					<p>Make sure to stop by when you visit. The entrance fee is only 300 yen for adults and 200 yen for high school students and younger!</p></div>

After stepping inside, you'll have about 800 stores to choose from ranging from arcades, and restaurants, to clothing stores. It takes about 40 minutes to walk across the whole street, but it alone has a day's worth of activities that won't have you walking through without stopping at least one store.</p>
					<p>Tenjinbashi-suji Shopping Street is in the Tenma district, is also known for the Osaka Museum of Housing and Living, and the Tenmangū Shrine. Both of which aren't far from Tenjinbashi-suji itself. If you head in the summer, you might be able to catch the Tenjin Festival held on July 24-25 of every year.</p></div>
